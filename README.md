# Lidar

A virtual reality game where you have to find your way out of a maze you can't see. Use your lidar (basically a laser coupled with a camera) to find your way out and avoid the obstacles.

This project is still in early development. The game is playable but many features are still missing, and will hopefully be added in the future.

## Usage

The app is hosted at [https://lidar.bsodium.fr/](https://lidar.bsodium.fr/). You can also download the source code and run it locally. The app is written in TypeScript React, uses [Joy-UI](https://mui.com/) for the UI and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for WebGL and WebXR rendering.
